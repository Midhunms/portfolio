# shiftMD

As a healthcare provider, you are constantly recommending non prescription, therapeutic, first-line products to your patients. You don’t know if they heed that advice and go to the pharmacy or online to purchase what you recommend. With the literally thousands of products online, your patient may not actually purchase the product with the specific ingredients or affects that you as the healthcare provider actually intended.

With the shiftMD app, you can easily find the product, establish the duration of therapy and send it directly to your patient. You will have full visibility to ensure your patient’s compliance, as well as full access to learn about the existing products on the platform and alerted when new ones become available.
With shiftMD you’ll provide value to your patients by:

• Saving them time wasted with pharmacy visits

• Saving them time and confusion spent traversing the online retailers

• Saving them money since the products you recommend through shiftMD are usually priced better than anywhere

• Convenience since the products are discretely shipped to their home for the allotted time designated
